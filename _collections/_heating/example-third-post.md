# Future Work

This is a list of things I'm going to do in the future to further enhance the heating system.

## Bathroom Smart Thermostat

- 35 - 50 eur
- Homematic IP makes a range of battery powered smart radiator thermostats
- I'm going to replace our existing TRV radiator valve in our bathroom with one of these thermostats so that we can independently heat our bathroom without needing one of the heating zones to call for heat

## Power Supplies for Wall Thermostats

- 50 eur each
- Homematic IP makes a 230VAC power supply for the battery powered thermostats
  - https://homematic-ip.com/en/product/power-supply-unit-brand-switches
- With this, you can add this into your wall next to a light switch or outlet and power your thermostats continuously from the mains, no batteries needed
- Obviously, this is much more involved than just batteries, but nice to have the option!

## Change Access Point to Local Control

- 75 - 150 eur
- The rest of our smart home is controlled via local APIs via Home Assistant
- Homematic's Access Point is an excellent and affordable way to get a modern heating system into the apartment
- However, I'd like more local control, and I'm comfortable managing our own external access to the home
- With that, I'll eventually switch to Homematic IP's other options for the "central brain", either the CCU3 or the community's open source RaspberryMatic
